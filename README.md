# SQL Injection

## Objective 

SQL Injection is an attack in order to manipulate a web application database queries to execute arbitrary SQL code. This can lead to various malicious outcomes, depending on the attacker's goals and the vulnerabilities in the system.

### Skills Learned 

- Data manipulation in knowing how to alter or delete data leading to data corruption, loss of records or unathorized changes to the database. 
- Ability to generate and recognize when attackers can log in as the other users and including administators, without knowing their password by injection of code that bypasses authentication checks.
- Proficent in Database control in demonstrating me bieng the attacker and being able to get and execute adminstrative operations on the database and elevating from lower privileges to administrative operations.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity
- Enhanced knowledge in Web Application Defacement, such as modifying web content stored in the database by defacing websites by altering text, images, or links.

### Tools Used 

- Web penetration testing software such as BurpSuite for testing and exploiting security flaws.
- Java based coding called jSQL for injection of the malware to the website that is being altered.
- OWASP ZAP which is an open source security tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications, including SQL injection and also includes automated scanners and a set of tools for manually testing applications
